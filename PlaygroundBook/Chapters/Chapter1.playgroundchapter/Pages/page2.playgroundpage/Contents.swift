 # Renewing the heart ðŸ’–
 
 The hug has the power to **normalize heart rate and blood pressure**, as well as decrease the risk of heart-related diseases. This is due to the level of oxytocin released in the body.
 
 This process of cardiac balance also receives a contribution from the receptors located in the skin, which act as a pressure-center network that is in contact with the brain through nerves connected to various organs, including the heart.
 
 
 
 **Goal:** See what happens to our brain when we get a really good hug by typing in the correct commands
 
 1. Visit the brain to see what happens there ðŸ§ 
 2. Activate the brain region called hypothalamus
 3. With the hypothalamus activated release the hormone called oxytocin
 4. Decrease levels of anxiety and be happy! ðŸ¤©

 # Renewing the heart 
 
 The hug has the power to **normalize heart rate and blood pressure**, as well as decrease the risk of heart-related diseases. This is due to the level of oxytocin released in the body.
 
 This process of cardiac balance also receives a contribution from the receptors located in the skin, which act as a pressure-center network that is in contact with the brain through nerves connected to various organs, including the heart.

 
 **On every step tap** Run my code to show the changes you make

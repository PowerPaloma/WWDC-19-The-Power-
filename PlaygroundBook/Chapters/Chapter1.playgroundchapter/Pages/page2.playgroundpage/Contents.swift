 # Renewing the heart ðŸ’–
 
 The hug has the power to **normalize heart rate and blood pressure**, as well as decrease the risk of heart-related diseases. This is due to the level of **oxytocin** released in the body.
 
 This process of cardiac balance also receives a contribution from the receptors located in the skin, which act as a **pressure-center network** that is in contact with the brain through nerves connected to various organs, including the heart.
 
 Let's visit the heart to see in details what happens there ðŸ˜ƒ?
 
 **Go ahead!**
 
1. Use the ``visitHeart()`` command to visit heart ðŸ’œ
2. **Swipe down** to released a hormone called oxytocin until the heart is calmer and free from disease risks
